Exploring effect of post types (Ask HN/Show HN) and post time on number of comments received

Link to Jupyter Notebook: [notebook](Basics.ipynb)

My analysis shows that:
- Ask posts receive more comments than show posts on average. 
- An ask post create at 3 PM, 2 AM or 8 PM (UTC) have higher chance of receiving comments than other ask posts.
- A Show HN posts at 6 PM, 12 AM and 2 PM receive more comments than show posts at other times.
